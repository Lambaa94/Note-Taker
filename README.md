## Description

This is my first live page that has been deployed with *Heroku*. I have learned to create a local server and work with testing code before going fully live. I like that there are many steps that you can take to make sure that your application is working properly. Some challenges I faced with this note taker was understanding of telling the computer to read and write files when necessary. With many cases involving plenty of trial and error, I finally came across a solution.

This has definitely sparked my interest to dive more into databases and servers. This skill will be crucial to becoming a truly full stack Web Developer.
